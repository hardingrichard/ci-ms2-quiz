### Design Choice
The website was created in a way in which to to make it intuitive and convenient for the user to navigate.
Using the national colours of Colombia (Yellow, Blue, Red) to bring familiary and make it clear what the site
has to do with and is about. The colours being bright and contrasting also provides an aspect of fun which
compliments the purpose of the website in which to play a game. The site was designed to be free from distracting 
elements from popping up on the screen and page links were used in the navigation bar to take the user straight to 
each section of the landing page than needing to scroll. The website consists of the one landing page which features 
a How To Play section giving users instructions on how to play, a Quiz section where the users can partake in the 
quiz and test their knowledge as well as a scores section so that users can see how well they did.
